### [Actotal Challenge](https://actotal-challenge.vercel.app/home)
**Description:** Actotal Challenge is a project I had the opportunity to create for my current company. It is a single-page application designed to create and edit records in a proprietary database within a 72-hour timeframe.

**Note:** The API is hosted on Render, and it may take 3-5 minutes to respond initially, as it is in a "sleeping" state. It will wake up and become fully responsive a few minutes after the first request.

**Tech Stack:** Node Js, Express, Mongo DB, React (typical MERN combination).

**Repositories:**
[API Repositoy Link](https://github.com/fernandosegoviadev/ACTotal-Challenge---Client)

**Note:** Let me know if you need access to the previous repositories. They are private at the request of Actotal, but I can share them with you if I know who you are.
